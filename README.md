This project uses a region-specific traffic management dataset focused exclusively on the Chennai Central area, Tamil Nadu.
The dataset is designed to support traffic analysis, congestion assessment, violation monitoring, and road condition evaluation within a single metropolitan region, enabling detailed urban traffic insights rather than broad multi-city or state-level comparisons.

**Geographic Scope**

State: Tamil Nadu

City: Chennai

Region: Chennai Central

Coverage: 1000 traffic records across major roads and junctions

Granularity: Road-level and junction-level traffic observations

Examples: Anna Salai, EVR Periyar Salai, Poonamallee High Road, Wall Tax Road

This localized focus allows micro-level traffic behavior analysis, which is not achievable using generalized or state-wide datasets.

**Dataset Size**

Number of rows: 1000

Number of columns: 15

File format: Excel (.xlsx)

File name: Traffic_Management_Dataset_Chennai_NoTimestamp.xlsx

**Data Characteristics**

The dataset is synthetically generated but realistic, designed to reflect real-world urban traffic behavior.

Values are constrained within practical city-traffic ranges.

Timestamp data is intentionally excluded to enable region-based analysis independent of time.
