This dataset represents a Traffic Management System for the Chennai Central region, Tamil Nadu. It contains 1000 structured traffic records collected across multiple major roads and junctions. The dataset is designed to simulate real-world urban traffic conditions and supports analysis related to vehicle movement, congestion, road conditions, and traffic rule compliance.

Each record includes detailed information such as vehicle type, speed, lane usage, traffic signal status, congestion level, weather conditions, and accident reports. The dataset does not include timestamp data, making it suitable for region-based traffic analysis without time dependency.

This dataset can be effectively used for DBMS projects, traffic analytics, smart city research, visualization dashboards, and machine learning model development. It provides a realistic foundation for studying traffic patterns, identifying congestion-prone areas, and designing intelligent traffic management solutions.
